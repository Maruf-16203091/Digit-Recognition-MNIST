# MNIST Digit Recognition with TensorFlow

This project demonstrates a simple digit recognition model trained on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview

- Loads the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits (0-9).
- Normalizes images and preprocesses data.
- Builds a simple neural network with one hidden dense layer.
- Trains the model for 5 epochs.
- Evaluates accuracy on the test set.
- Visualizes predictions on sample test images.

## How to run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook `digit_recognition.ipynb` in Google Colab or any Jupyter environment.
3. Run the notebook cells step-by-step.
4. The model will train and then display accuracy and sample predictions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (tested with TensorFlow 2.x)
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

You can install dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
